// SPARC content layer — members.
//
// Source of truth: app/team/page.tsx. Every value is copy-paste traceable; do
// not edit by memory. Shape mirrors `create table members` in supabase/schema.sql.
//
// MERGE: the live /team page renders 17 cards for 12 people — Kanan, Montasir,
// Bexultan, Endi and Allan each appear in BOTH the `team` array (heading "Team
// of 2025", page.tsx:240) and the `team2026` array (heading "Team of 2026",
// page.tsx:158). They are merged to one entry each:
//   • `role` / `role_term` come from team2026 ('2026' is the heading's own year
//     string — not '2026–27', which came from the deleted, wrong SQL seed).
//   • their 2025 role from `team` moves into `role_history`.
//
// role_history format: a term-bound office is stored as '<role>, 2025' (year
// from the "Team of 2025" heading). 'Founding Member' is stored bare, matching
// the schema's own example (`role_history text[] ... -- {'Founding Member'}`);
// it is a standing status, not an office held in a particular year.
//
// badges: club-supplied, NOT derived from the repo — see the provenance note at
// the bottom of this header.
//
// photo: same basename as the repo's `image` field, with the .webp re-exports
// in public/images/ (e.g. /mo.jpeg → /images/mo.webp, /monty.png →
// /images/monty.webp). All 12 targets verified present.
//
// class_year: parsed from the 'Class of 20XX' half of the repo's role string.
// slug: kebab-case of `name`.
// sort_order: the five e-board members first, in team2026's own order
// (10,20,30,40,50), then everyone else in the `team` array's own order
// (100,110,…160).
//
// status: club-supplied, confirmed Aug 2026 via the orchestrator (resolves
// PLAN.md §5.1). The four Class-of-2026 members — Mohammed, Sarmad, Kyle and
// Anthony — are alumni; everyone else is current. This is SOURCED DATA, not
// inference from class years: a future member classed 2026 would NOT
// automatically be alumni, so do not derive this field — read it.
//
// badges + participated: club-supplied, confirmed Aug 2026 via the orchestrator
// (resolves the SPEC "Content that does not exist yet" item). Three facts:
//   • all 12 members are founding members;
//   • all 12 except Allan Nguyen did the CollegiateX internship;
//   • all 12 participated in 2025 and 2026.
//
// 'founding' is now CLUB-SUPPLIED STATUS and is no longer derived from the repo
// role strings. This matters, because for five people the two disagree: the repo
// role for Mohammed, Sarmad, Kyle, Endi and Montasir reads President /
// Vice-President / Treasurer / Secretary / Project Lead (Website), never
// "Founding Member". They carry the badge on the club's word, not the repo's.
// Do not "correct" this back to the repo strings, and do not re-derive the field
// from `role` or `role_history` — read it.
