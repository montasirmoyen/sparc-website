/* Home — the two sections added after the client review ("the home page is
 * empty", two mockups supplied Aug 2026). Both are STATIC SERVER MARKUP: no
 * "use client", no WAAPI, no rAF, no observers. The photo drift stays the
 * only moving thing on this page, which is what SPEC's "the hero and the
 * drift must not both be moving at once" is protecting — a third animated
 * band would break that guarantee by a different route.
 *
 * They live in a sibling rather than in page.tsx only to keep page.tsx as
 * composition; nothing here needs its own module boundary.
 *
 * PROVENANCE. Every visible string below is either (a) countable data read
 * off lib/content, (b) copy already in the repo with the file:line given, or
 * (c) a string the client wrote in the mockup, each one marked
 * `client mockup, Aug 2026`. Nothing is written here.
 *
 * MOTION. One hover, `.lift` from globals.css — the site's existing -2px
 * card hover, already wrapped in @media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)
 * at 200ms. No new mechanism and no new CSS.

/* ── stats band ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Mockup A: a full-width band, four tiles, vertical hairlines between them
 * and a hairline above and below the row.
 *
 * The band is bg-surface-1 between two border-line hairlines, NOT a forced
 * .dark ramp. The mockup is a dark-theme screenshot, and a band pinned dark
 * in every theme would be a new theming mechanism nobody asked for; on the
 * dark and dim ramps surface-1 IS the dark band the client drew. Flagged to
 * the orchestrator rather than decided silently.
 *
 * SCREEN READERS. The value/label pair is a <dl>: MicroLabel as="dt" first
 * in the DOM, the value in a <dd> after it, and flex-col-reverse puts the
 * value on top visually without reordering the pair. This is the same
 * structure the /about facts strip already uses (app/about/page.tsx:153-162)
 * — one pattern for one idea, so the two read identically.
 *
 * ULTRA — SPEC AMENDMENT. SPEC caps the poster face at three appearances
 * (hero, footer wordmark, /about statement); these four values are a FOURTH,
 * approved by the client's own mockup and rendered only through PosterText,
 * which is still the only way the face is allowed on screen
 * (components/ui/poster-text.tsx). Nothing else on this page uses it — the
 * news heading below is Martian.
 *
 * COUNTS ARE DERIVED, NEVER TYPED. Anything countable is read off
 * lib/content so a stat cannot disagree with the page that lists the items.

 * where every card and the chip point; news has no detail pages.

 * repo stored as a display string ("Fri, 24 Apr 2026"), so the weekday on
 * screen is the weekday the calendar says. An explicit locale, not the
 * runtime default, so the prerendered HTML is deterministic.
 *
 * ALT TEXT is empty. These are undescribed club photos and the card's own
 * title sits next to each one, so the image is decorative in context —
 * describing it would either repeat the title or invent a caption. (The
 * gallery in page.tsx numbers its photos instead, because there is no
 * adjacent text there to carry the meaning.)
