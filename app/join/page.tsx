/* /join — the merged join + contact page. Server component, no client JS.
 *
 * /contact is deleted; next.config.ts redirects it here (owned by the
 * orchestrator, not touched from this file).
 *
 * CONTENT RULE. Every visible string on this page is lifted from the two
 * pages this one replaces — app/join/page.tsx and app/contact/page.tsx as
 * they stood before this rewrite — or from the approved provenance list
 * (biweekly cadence, "73 Tremont, Room 8065", the Discord invite). Copy is
 * TRIMMED in places; nothing is reworded and nothing is written. Line
 * references below are to those two files at their pre-rewrite state.
 *
 * Two deletions worth naming:
 *  - "…for Spring 2026" is gone from the recruiting line (join:28). The term
 *    was already stale and this page prerenders, so deriving one via
 *    currentTerm() would just bake the build date in instead. The sentence
 *    minus the term is the same sentence.
 *  - "Our regular meeting times are still being finalized" (contact:122) is
 *    stale — the club confirmed biweekly meetings in 73 Tremont, Room 8065,
 *    which is what the primary panel now states. The rest of that paragraph
 *    ("we will share meeting details once they join") went with it for the
 *    same reason.
 *
 * HIERARCHY. Discord is the dominant call to action and the form is
 * subordinate to it, per SPEC "/join": the Discord panel is full-width,
 * accent-tinted, carries the page's only accent-filled control at text-lg,
 * and sits directly under the lead. The Google Form and the questions
 * mailto follow it as small outline links at text-sm — after it, never
 * above it, never filled.
 *
 * The panel is a plain div rather than <SurfaceCard>: cn() is a plain join
 * with no conflict resolution (see components/ui/surface-card.tsx), so a
 * bg-accent-quiet passed through className would race the card's own
 * bg-surface-1 in the cascade rather than beat it. Cards that want the
 * default surface still use the primitive.
 *
 * MOTION. Hover states only, per SPEC. Everything here is a CSS transition,
 * so the universal prefers-reduced-motion block in globals.css already
 * covers it, and Tailwind v4 wraps `hover:` in (hover: hover) and
 * (pointer: fine) itself. No JS-driven motion, no expand — nothing on this
 * page hides content behind a disclosure.
