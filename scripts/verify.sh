# WHO OWNS THIS FILE
#   The orchestrator, and nobody else. If you are a subagent working on a
#   step, you may not edit this file — not to add a path, not to relax a
#   check, not to silence a failure. Report the problem instead.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE MIGRATED-PATH LIST
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Why this exists: the redesign lands one step at a time, but the old pages
# keep their 236 stock-palette references, their sub-13px type and their
# `unoptimized` props until the step that rewrites them runs. A check that
# swept all of app/ and components/ from day one would fail on code nobody
# had touched yet, and "verify.sh is red" would stop meaning anything.
#
# So the style checks below run against this list only. A path goes on it
# the moment its step is reviewed and integrated — after which a regression
# in it fails the build immediately, which is the point.
#
# The build and the redirect checks always run repo-wide.
#
# Add one path per line. Keep the step comment. Do not sort — chronological
# order is the migration history.

  components/ui/expand.tsx      # S2 — THE expand; a second one anywhere is a bug
  components/ui/pill.tsx        # S2 — badge pill, wrap rules baked in
  components/ui/filter-chip.tsx # S2 — aria-pressed filter toggle
