 * app/about/page.tsx is a server component (it owns the metadata export and

 * next to the page rather than in components/ui/ because neither is a
 * primitive — PeopleDirectory is this page's filter state, and PhotoReveal is
 * this page's one signature motion.
 *
 * CONTENT RULE. The only literal strings here are the three filter labels,
 * which SPEC names itself ("Current, Alumni and E-Board are filters, not
 * pills"). No name, role, year or count is typed — members arrive as a prop
 * from the server page, which reads lib/content/members.ts, and every count is
 * computed from that array.

/* ── the group photo reveal ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * SPEC "Motion, site-wide": About's one motion is a clip-path reveal on the
 * group photo, on scroll, fired once. Scroll reveals use `clip-path: inset()`
 * with IntersectionObserver at `{ once: true }` — here that is one
 * `disconnect()` inside the callback, so the observer stops watching the
 * moment it fires and the reveal cannot replay.
 *
 * REDUCED MOTION, two ways, both in this commit:
 *  1. The effect reads prefers-reduced-motion and, when it is set, never arms
 *     the clip at all. The photo is simply there — which is the right reduced
 *     behaviour for an entrance, rather than a 0.01ms wipe.
 *  2. The transition is a plain CSS transition, so the universal
 *     prefers-reduced-motion block in globals.css flattens its duration with
 *     !important — important author declarations beat inline styles, so the
 *     inline transition below is covered even if (1) is somehow bypassed.
 *
 * WHY THE UNCLIPPED STATE IS THE INITIAL ONE. The server renders `open`, so
 * the HTML that ships — and the page a reader with JavaScript off sees — has
 * the photo fully visible. The clip is applied on mount in a layout effect,
 * which React flushes before the browser paints, so the first painted frame is
 * already the clipped one and there is no flash of the photo appearing and
 * then hiding. useLayoutEffect would warn during SSR, hence the alias.

/* ── people ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Filters, not pills. Three of them, and each one's count is derived:
 *
 *   Current / Alumni — `status`, which members.ts:33 is explicit is sourced
 *     data and must be read, never inferred from a class year.
 *   E-Board — sort_order < 100. members.ts:29 defines the order as "the five
 *     e-board members first, in team2026's own order (10,20,30,40,50), then
 *     everyone else in the `team` array's own order (100,110,…160)", so the
 *     e-board is exactly the block below 100. Deriving it from `role` would
 *     mean deciding which role strings count as offices, and deriving it from
 *     role_term === '2026' would sweep in anyone who happens to hold that
 *     term later.
 *
 * A filter whose count is zero is not rendered.
 *
 * SELECTION MODEL: single-select, and pressing the pressed chip clears it.
 * Multi-select would have to answer what Current + Alumni means — the union is
 * everyone (the filter row does nothing) and the intersection is nobody (the
 * grid empties). One at a time has neither failure mode, and the counts on the
 * chips already tell you the size of every set without pressing anything.
